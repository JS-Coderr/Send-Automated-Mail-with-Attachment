**Prefered Platform Google Colab**
Let's break down the provided code:

1. **Setting Up Email Parameters**:
   - The code initializes two variables: `fromaddr` (the sender's email address) and `toaddr` (the recipient's email address).
   - It also creates an instance of `MIMEMultipart()` to construct the email message.

2. **Setting Email Headers**:
   - The sender's email address is set as the "From" address, the recipient's address as the "To" address, and the subject as "Test Mail-Sample."

3. **Email Body**:
   - The email body is set to "Body of the mail."
   - The `MIMEText` class is used to attach the body to the email message.

4. **Attaching a File**:
   - The code attaches a file (specified by `file_path`, which should be replaced with the actual file path) to the email.
   - It reads the file content and encodes it as base64.
   - The attachment's header specifies the filename.

5. **Connecting to Gmail SMTP Server**:
   - The code connects to Gmail's SMTP server (`smtp.gmail.com`) on port 587.
   - It starts a TLS (Transport Layer Security) session for secure communication.

6. **Logging In to Gmail Account**:
   - The sender's Gmail account is logged in using the provided password (which is currently obscured).

7. **Sending the Email**:
   - The email message (including the body and attachment) is sent using `mailServer.sendmail()`.
   - The sender's address, recipient's address, and the complete message are passed as arguments.

8. **Closing the Connection**:
   - Finally, the connection to the SMTP server is closed using `mailServer.quit()`.

Remember to replace the placeholder values (such as the actual email addresses, password, and file path) with appropriate values for your use case.
